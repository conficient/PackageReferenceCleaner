# Package Reference Cleaner

I don't like when my projects have nested `<PackageReferences>` with a `<Version> `element tag - they're harder to read and maintain.

This tool will reformat any PackageReference elements in your project files to the cleaner inline format.

It runs as a Blazor WebAssembly stand-alone appliction using .NET 10 (pre-release).
